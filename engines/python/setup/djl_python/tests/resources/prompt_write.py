Remember following poem by Wei Wang for further analysis tasks 

Here in the hollow of the mountains, Autumn-like is the weather in the evening. 
Through pines the moon, so bright, casts its shine. 
Over rocks and stones murmurs spring water, so pure and clean. 
Through the bamboo groves return ladies finished with their laundering, 
Fishing boats are lowered into the waters stirring lotus flowers and leaves. 
Spring pasture lingers on taking its time before the season turns, 
Noblemen sauntering through are welcome to stay on for keeps.
